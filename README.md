# SchoolApp

A simple Next.js + TypeScript application for managing school entries (local project workspace).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=16)
- pnpm (recommended)

## Install

```powershell
pnpm install
```

## Development

```powershell
pnpm dev
```

## Build

```powershell
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Environment

Create a `.env.local` in the project root for any environment variables required by the app (do not commit secrets).

## Notes

- `.gitignore` added to exclude build artifacts and local files.
- If you want, I can add a more detailed README with architecture notes, API routes, and instructions for contributing.
